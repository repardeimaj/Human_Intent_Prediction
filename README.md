# Human_Intent_Prediction
Repository for the URP project exploring methods for robots to predict human intentions using Graph Neural Networks


## To use (on Paternain reserch laptop):

```
cd HIP_ws
conda activate HIP
```

run desired python file:

### sequence_model.py:
Train and save a TensorFlow GNN, CNN, or RNN sequence model for human intent prediction

### evaluation.py
Evaluate saved TensorFlow model on long testing sequences

### visualizer.py
Contains useful visualization methods for plotting graph data and human pose sequences in 3D space

## To use (other):

clone the reposity and be sure to install all the necessary dependencies including TensorFlow and ROS
